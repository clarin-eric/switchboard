My Clowne (who wants but some-<lb n="2482" rend="rj" type="inWord"/>thing to be a reasonable man) grew so in loue with the<lb n="2483" rend="rj"/>Wenches Song, that hee would not stirre his Petty-toes,<lb n="2484" rend="rj"/>till he had both Tune and Words, which so drew the rest<lb n="2485" rend="rj"/>of the Heard to me, that all their other Sences stucke in<lb n="2486" rend="rj"/>Eares: you might haue pinch'd a Placket, it was sence-<lb n="2487" rend="rj" type="inWord"/>lesse; 'twas nothing to gueld a Cod-peece of a Purse: I<lb n="2488" rend="rj"/>would haue fill'd Keyes of that hung in Chaynes: no<lb n="2489" rend="rj"/>hearing, no feeling, but my Sirs Song, and admiring the<lb n="2490" rend="rj"/>Nothing of it. So that in this time of Lethargie, I pickd<lb n="2491" rend="rj"/>and cut most of their Festiuall Purses: And had not the<lb n="2492" rend="rj"/>old-man come in with a Whoo-bub against his Daugh-<lb type="inWord" n="2493" rend="rj"/>ter, and the Kings Sonne, and scar'd my Chowghes from<lb n="2494" rend="rj"/>the Chaffe, I had not left a Purse aliue in the whole<lb n="2495"/>Army.<lb n="2496" rend="rj"/>
